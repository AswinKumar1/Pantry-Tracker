# Pantry Tracker

## Description

Pantry Tracker is a web application designed to help you manage your pantry items. It allows you to add, update, delete, and search for pantry items, as well as generate recipes based on the items you have using Openrouter AI. 

It is created as part of the Headstarter SWE Fellowship for the tasks of Week #2, where we have to use React.js, Next.js, Firebase and deploy the web application using Vercel's CI/CD. Also, there were some bonus points for utilizing the camera feature where one can capture the image of the item that needs to be added in the tracker and also create a recipe based on the available items in the pantry using OpenAI/OpenrouterAI.
